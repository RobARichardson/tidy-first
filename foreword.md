# Foreword

This Book is for Professional Programmers - developers with a deep & geeky interest in their craft and in improving their work in small ways with big payoffs.

Practicing software developers often pay scant attention to theory, but this book mixes practice & theory making it both readable & practical.

> In theory, this is no difference between theory & practice while in practice there is.  \~ Benjamin Brewster

This is a profession that hinges on getting the details right.

The complexity of code depends on how it is organized into parts, on how coupled those parts are with each other, and how cohesive the parts are in themselves.

Coupling and cohesion are simply measures of the complexity of computer code from the perspective of human beings trying to understand the code. Coupling and cohesion are really about how your brain details with complicated systems.
