# 2. Dead Code

## Delete it&#x20;

If the code doesn't get executed, just delete it.

## Deleting dead code can be strange

* Someone took the time & effort to write it.&#x20;
* The organization paid for it.
* All somebody needs to do to make it valuable is to call it again.
* If we need it, we'll be sad we deleted it.

How many cognitive biases are in the reasons above?

## What if we need it later?

We have Version Control.  If worse comes to worst, we can always get it back.&#x20;

Or, we can just write it again, but better.  What's the likelihood we will use it again in exactly the same way it was originally written?
