# 11: Chunk Statements

You're reading a large chunk of code when you realize...._Oh, this part does this and then that part does that_.  **Stop and put a blank line between the parts.**

This tidying is very, very simple. The philosophy of Tidy First is to not make software design such a big deal that we are in danger of not doing it.  A little software design can make change a little easier.&#x20;

### Compound Interest

Software design also makes more software design easier. Done well, software design enables software design that enables change.

### What's next?

After you've chunked statements, you have many paths forward such as [Explaining Variables](8-explaining-variables.md), [Extract Helper](12-extract-helper.md), or [Explaining Comments](14-explaining-comments.md).
