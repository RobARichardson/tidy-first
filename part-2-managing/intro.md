# Intro

### Tidying is geek self-care.

* The mechanics of tidyings will come to you with practice.
* We should get used to designing software a little at a time, all the time. &#x20;
* Tidyings are gateway refactorings
* Being able to identify that a tidying applies and applying it doesn't mean you mastered it.
* Just because you can tidy doesn't mean you should.

### How can we fit tidying into a personal development workflow?

* When do you start?
* When do you stop?
* When do you combine tidying and changes in behavior?
